Hide-n-Stab!
============

Hide-n-Stab is an online, multiplayer stealth action game.

There are many cloaked figures that appear identical, but they differ beneath 
the surface - some are other players like yourself, while others are only 
harmless bundles of clothes.

Your goal is to kill other players without being killed yourself. You can only 
kill someone by stabbing them from behind.

Whenever you attack, your eyes will glow and your knife will be visible, 
revealing you to other players as a human for a short time, so be careful and 
stay hidden until the time is right to strike.
